## Introduction
### Project Overview
### Goals and Objectives

## Software Architectural Design (as appropriate)
### Required External Libraries
### Functional Block Diagrams
### Data Flow Diagrams
### UML Diagrams showing Object Definition/Inheritance

## Interface Descriptions (as appropriate)
### Graphical Interface
### Data Visualization
### Communications Protocols
### Threading and Concurrency
### Exception Handling

## Testing and Evaluation

### Operating system(s) and software compiler/library version(s) tested
### Description of functional testing to date
### Instructions for compiling and running the software

## Conclusions
### Major Accomplishments
- Reasonable and logical class hierarchy design
- An reasonable and concise GUI
- Interaction using mouse
  - Zoom in/out with mouse wheel.
  - Double click to switch the view horizontally and vertically
  - Click on background, adjust view with left button.
  - Click on abstronomical object, drag it along trajectory with left button.
- 3D display of the system.
- Highlight the selected astronomical object with introduction and hide the others.
- Customize date and time to switch to corresponding status
- Customize time speed to fast foward/rewind the simulation
- Customize parameter of selected astronomical object and verify the input.
### Results of the software development effort
### Were you successful in meeting all goals and objectives?  What didn't work?  What would take more time?

## Future Work
The software has provided APIs for customizing parameters of astronomical objects, which aims to simulate the real scene in solar system when when the property of objects changes suddenly.

## Author Contributions

Ming Xu designed class hierarchy and completed computing the status of astronomical objects.

Geng Yang designed the GUI, completed basic interactions and 3D display.

Xingchen Ming was responsible for parameter configuration, exception handling and interaction between user and astronomical objects.
