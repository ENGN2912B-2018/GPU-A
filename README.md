1.Upload the first version of implementation of AstronmicalObject and SoloarSystem.
2.Those two class are based on "glut", and some fundimental functions including drawing a sphere and updating the postion were implemented.
3.A toy example function is provided to test those two classes. The program reads in a txt file storing the parameters for objects in the solar system and show the whole system in a window.
4.However, this whole part is based on glut. To run this function, one should install the glut library. Since the glut is included by Xcode on Mac OS, one can use Xcode to build this program.
